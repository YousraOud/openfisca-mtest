    Household is an example of a group entity.
    A group entity contains one or more individualÂ·s.
    Each individual in a group entity has a role (e.g. parent or children). Some roles can only be held by a limited number of individuals (e.g. a 'first_parent' can only be held by one individual), while others can have an unlimited number of individuals (e.g. 'children').

    Example:
    Housing variables (e.g. housing_tax') are usually defined for a group entity such as 'Household'.

    Usage:
    Check the number of individuals of a specific role (e.g. check if there is a 'second_parent' with household.nb_Contribuables(Household.SECOND_PARENT)).
    Calculate a variable applied to each individual of the group entity (e.g. calculate the 'salaire' of each member of the 'Household' with salaries = household.members("salaire", period = MONTH); sum_salaries = household.sum(salaries)).
